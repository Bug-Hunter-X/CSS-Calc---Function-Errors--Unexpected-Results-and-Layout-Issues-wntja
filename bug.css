The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it may lead to unexpected results if not used carefully.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not work as expected if the parent element's width isn't explicitly defined.  Another common issue is using `calc()` with units inconsistently (mixing percentages and pixels without proper conversion).
