To fix the issues, ensure that:

1. The parent element has explicitly defined dimensions (width or height) for percentage-based calculations in `calc()` to work correctly.
2. Units are used consistently within the `calc()` function. Avoid mixing different units such as percentages and pixels without appropriate conversion.  If mixing is necessary, ensure calculations are done correctly and consistently.
3. Carefully check the browser's developer tools to examine the calculated values and identify discrepancies or unexpected values.  This helps pinpoint where the calculation goes wrong.

Here's an example of a corrected CSS rule:

```css
.container {
  width: 500px; /* Explicit width for the parent */
}

.element {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
}
```

In this corrected version, the `.container` has a defined width.  This allows `calc(100% - 20px)` to produce the expected result for the `.element` width.
